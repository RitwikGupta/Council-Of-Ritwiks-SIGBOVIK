\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The distribution of Ritwiks across the world is a question pursued by countless researchers across a variety of fields. A yet unanswered question\footnote{https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en\&as\_sdt=0\%2C39\&q=distribution+of+ritwiks\&btnG=}, we seek to once and for all put this question to rest. We also provide auxiliary discussion and proofs demonstrating various statistical properties of the Ritwik population.
\end{abstract}

\section{Distribution of Ritwiks}
Comprehensive, boots on the ground research was done to effectively determine the distribution of Ritwiks across the world. Using Facebook\footnote{https://facebook.com}, we were able to ascertain the location of and establish contact with Ritwiks everywhere (see Figure \ref{fig:ritwikgeographicaldistro}).

\end{figure}
We collected a large sample size ($N = 12$) and used Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to simulate certain parameters that are backed by Bayesian goodness, undeniably proving that our method is rock solid. We cast a net out to collect the samples , the deep kind of net therefore guaranteeing the best sample. All data was analyzed with cutting edge tools \cite{Zaharia:2012:RDD:2228298.2228301, PyMC3}. The following math not only looks cool, but makes reviewers think that we did real work because math makes it look that way.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
Count_i \sim Poi(\lambda),\\
\lambda \sim DiscreteUniform(0, 7e9),\\
\int_{\lambda}\pi(q)f(q)\sum{\frac{Var_\pi[f]}{ESS}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\section{Relative Frequency of ``Ritwik"}
Ritwik is a low frequency name. This has been shown to be true using time-tested methods of expected author intuition level. Li et. al. \cite{Baby}states that low frequency names are related to each other using Zipf's law which is stated as follows:

"ADD LIPF'S MATHEMATICAL EQN WITH FANCY ZERO CONSTANTS HERE"

But we have to show that this paper is original and novel. Therefore we use deep learning even to learn a simple distribution which gives us a significant improvement(of 0.1$\%$'). This boost was definitely not due to a better initialization but due to our carefully thought out and fancy architecture. To make our results reproducible we have stuck to top-notch academic practices of releasing all of our code on private github repositories. 
"LETS ADD A FAKE FIGURE TOO ? " 


\section{Popularity of ``Ritwik" Over Time}
Though Ritwiks themselves are insanely popular\footnote{Refer to our peers.}, the name Ritwik itself has not seen widespread gain in usage throughout history. Using historical databases, we were able to reconstruct the usage of the name and use popular methods such as randomly drawing a line that looks about right to estimate the future usage of the name as well (see \ref{fig:usageofritwik}).
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=4in]{figures/UsageOfRitwik}
	\caption{The occurrence of the name Ritwik over time. Green line represents the year this paper was published.}
	\label{fig:usageofritwik}
\end{figure}
As evident, the name Ritwik is predicted to skyrocket as this paper is made public. Eventually, all people will be named Ritwik, and the universe will be at peace.

\section{On the Immortality of Ritwiks}
\label{sec:Immortality}
Based on the vast quantity of Ritwiks we have met, none of them have been dead or deceased. As such, we are led to believe that all Ritwiks are immortal until the eventual heat death of the universe \cite{HeatDeath}.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:death}
	Given any Ritwik, the average lifespan of the individual will be $\infty$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/RitwikLackOfDeath}
	\caption{Search of the U.S. Social Security Death Index for ``Ritwik".}
	\label{fig:ritwiklackofdeath}
\end{figure}
\begin{proof}
Let us assume that all Ritwiks die, for the sake of contradiction. Therefore, a record of death must exist within the United States Social Security Death Index\footnote{http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=3693}. However, we can see in Figure \ref{fig:ritwiklackofdeath}, no records of deceased Ritwiks exist. Therefore, Lemma \ref{lemma:death} must hold.
\end{proof}

\section{Adversarial Ritwiks}
With the recent successes in people being able to finally spell our name properly, adversarial attacks against our nomenclature have become prevalent. Simple affine transformations often result in massive confusion amongst peers and colleagues. An example of these transformations can be seen in Table \ref{table:affineadversarial} below.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
	\hline 
	\textbf{Transformation}\\ 
	\hline 
	Rit\textbf{v}ik\\ 
	\hline 
	Ritwi\textbf{c}k\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Rick}\\
	\hline
	\textbf{H}rit\textbf{h}ik\\
	\hline
	\textbf{\textit{``How about I call you Rob?"}}\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example of affine transformations on the name ``Ritwik"}
\label{table:affineadversarial}
\end{table}
Many defenses exist against adversarial attacks against the name ``Ritwik". Papernot et. al. \cite{Papernot} suggests that distilling these toxic people out of your life demonstrates a sizable increase in the quality of life. However, many attacks have been shown directly bypassing distillation, which means that you're stuck with hearing various people call you different names for the rest of your life, which as show in Section \ref{sec:Immortality}, is forever.
